# Mobile-_Phones-_Price-_Range_Prediction
Implementing Classification Supervised ML for analyzing dataset of 2000 mobile phones' specifications to predict optimum price ranges based on mobile specifications.

Importing Pandas for data wrangling, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualizations, Hypothesis testing , Scikit Learn for model training, model optimization, and metrics calculation.

Implementing XGBoost classifier and linear regression model for accuracy in mobile price range prediction with Grid Search CV (Grid Search technique, cross-validation) for finding the optimal hyperparameters.

The training score is 100% and testing score is 89% with 89% precision, 89% recall & 89% f1-score.

Insights: 4 price range (low, medium, high, very high) of mobiles based on key features (RAM, battery power, pixels), variation of Weight, Bluetooth, RAM, Battery for low to high to very high cost.
